Real Time Crowd Analysis
Objective:
Our objective was to create a unique image processing application which is completely automated, needs no human intervention, is cost effective and as good as human performance if not better than it, which most present applications fail to do. Crowd Analytics is an area where getting data in real time is a gift. No wonder nowadays, it is the most active-oriented research and trendy topic in computer vision. Traditionally, three processing steps involve in crowd analysis, and these include pre-processing, object detection and event/ behavior recognition. However many existing applications do not process in real time.

Features: 
•	Face Detection – Find out the faces in the view of the camera (Real Time)
•	Attentiveness – Gives a real-time analysis of the faces being attentive or not, by analyzing the eyes
•	Emotion Recognition – Gives a continuous report of emotions of the faces analyzed (Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Disgust, Fear)
•	Unique people count – A real-time graph showing the number of unique people, so if the same person steps in again, the software is smart enough to know that it has seen the person before.
•	Gender Distribution – A real-time pie chart showing the gender distribution.
•	Can cover many faces which depends on the clarity as edge detections deteriorate with the increase in distance from the camera.
•	Given that the recommended configuration is followed, it will give almost instant results i.e., in real time(delay of ~100ms)
